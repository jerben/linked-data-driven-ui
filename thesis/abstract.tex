The main goal is to reduce the costs of UI development by implementing a new kind of UI framework. This framework can be used to create UIs that are driven by linked data. Instead of hardcoding domain knowledge into the UI, the UI is completely driven by the data it receives. That data is in a serialization format of linked data called JSON-LD.\\
The major design goals of the UI are to not break existing tooling and to be compatible with existing HTTP APIs. A convenient plugin mechanism provides UI developers with a way to override the default renderer and to plug-in custom renderers for certain data types.\\
For the development of the UI framework, I designed three real-world use cases to demonstrate the plugin mechanism of the custom renderer.


TODO: method, results, clarify UI framework, UI as artifact
