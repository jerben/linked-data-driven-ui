Accidental Complexity in contemporary software development is high, especially in UI development. A big chunk of UI development time is not spent on delivering business value but infrastructure work. This thesis explores an efficient approach to UI development by reducing Accidental Complexity.

We analyze hypermedia specifications and develop a proof of concept for a framework to create user interfaces by implementing two use cases. The first use case is a scenario in home automation and it is concerned with non-interactive user interfaces. The second use case describes a project management tool with focus on user interaction.

The combination of linked data, web components and \textit{Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State} reduces the complexity in development of user interfaces. Usage of the implemented framework reduces \gls{cognitive load}, decreases \textit{Complexity caused by State} and \textit{Complexity caused by Control} and significantly drives down maintenance costs.

The suggested approach to development of user interfaces constitutes an improvement over approaches without linked data and hypermedia.
