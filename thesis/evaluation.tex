\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}

Following paragraph evaluates the proof-of-concept of the UI framework. First, we verify if the design goals were met. Then we list the causes of Accidental Complexity and analyze for each of them if it can be reduced by using the UI framework or not.

\subsection{Design goals}\label{designgoals}

\subsubsection{Complexity}\label{complexity}
\subsubsection{Conformity}\label{conformity}
\subsubsection{Changeability}\label{changeability}
\subsubsection{Invisibility}\label{invisibility}
