\section{Background}\label{background}

This section discusses the problems with the process of developing UIs today. It also provides the theoretical backgroung by highlighting the main building blocks of the UI framework.

\subsection{Evolution of web UI development}\label{history}

In the early days of the Internet, websites were mostly \textbf{static files} accessible under certain URLs. Those files were often created manually or generated by using WYSIWYG editors. The served files were mostly styles (CSS), static assets and markup that the browsers had to render.

\textbf{Dynamically generated} content became popular with the rise of PHP. Websites were now able to show different things to each user based on previous interactions. The files that were served to the browsers were still the same static files. The markup was not hard coded anymore but dynamically rendered on the server upon user request.
\\ Developers had to work with templating languages to implement UIs that received that usually from the same server.

Websites became \textbf{truly interactive} with the introduction of AJAX. AJAX allowed the browser to asynchronously communicate with the server while the user was interacting with the website. Google was able to give search suggestions in real-time while the user was typing the search term. Websites were still rendered on the server but the served files additionally contained JavaScript that was run by the browser.
\\ UI development involved working with templating languages, styling and a small amount of programming.

The amount of interactive elements on websites and their \textbf{complexity increased}. What was once a text input field with real-time suggestions is now a full-text search interface with complex filtering and sorting options. The standardization of browser APIs was in the early stages and developers had to spend effort to create a consistent user experience across various browsers.
\\ Tools like jQuery emerged that provided a single interface for multiple browsers. The websites were still dynamically rendered on the server and just enriched in the browser by running JavaScript.

The first applications appeared that provided a user experience in the browser similar to the one of fat desktop applications. The files that the server sent to the browser were mostly JavaScript. The browser ran that JavaScript application to render the website and to react on user input. It communicated with the server using AJAX and the website was not rendered on the server anymore. Instead a single website was served on which the whole application lifecycle took place. \textbf{Single page applications} (SPA) were born.
\\ Development of UIs has drastically changed because the UI was part of an application that had its own lifecycle. Development of the server and the client application often took place separated. The HTTP API often played the role of an informal contract between client and server.

To this day a lot of UIs are developed that way. It is common to have a \textbf{frontend} team working on the client and the UI while the \textbf{backend} team work on the server. The frontend team makes sense of the data that comes from the server by either looking at it or ideally using some form of HTTP API documentation.
\\ There are efforts like Swagger or OpenAPI to formalize and standardize documentation for HTTP APIs.
